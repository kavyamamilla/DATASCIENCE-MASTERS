    "The stationarity of a time series refers to whether its statistical properties remain constant over time. A stationary time series exhibits consistent mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure across different time periods. On the other hand, a non-stationary time series shows changes in mean, variance, or other statistical properties as time progresses.\n",

    "Differences between Stationary and Non-Stationary Time Series:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean and Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationary: The mean and variance of a stationary time series remain constant over time.\n",
    "Non-Stationary: The mean and/or variance of a non-stationary time series change over time, often exhibiting trends or seasonality.\n",
    "Autocorrelation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationary: Autocorrelations between time points remain relatively constant across different lags.\n",
    "Non-Stationary: Autocorrelations might change with time, indicating dependencies between past and future values.\n",
    "Trends and Seasonality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationary: Stationary time series do not exhibit systematic trends or seasonality.\n",
    "Non-Stationary: Non-stationary time series can have trends (increasing or decreasing patterns) and/or seasonality (repeating patterns).\n",
    "The Stationarity's Impact on Forecasting Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice of Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationary Time Series: Stationary time series are easier to model and forecast because they exhibit consistent patterns that can be captured by standard time series models like ARIMA and exponential smoothing.\n",
    "Non-Stationary Time Series: Non-stationary time series require additional preprocessing, such as differencing, to achieve stationarity before applying forecasting models.\n",
    "Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationary Time Series: Forecasting models perform better on stationary time series because the underlying patterns are stable and easier to predict.\n",
    "Non-Stationary Time Series: Non-stationary time series might lead to inaccurate forecasts due to the changing patterns. Failing to account for non-stationarity can result in spurious correlations and misleading predictions.\n",
    "Differencing:\n",
    "\n",
    "To make non-stationary time series stationary, differencing can be applied. Differencing involves subtracting consecutive observations to eliminate trends or seasonality. Once differenced, the resulting series can be modeled using standard forecasting techniques.\n",
    "Integration (I) in ARIMA Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-stationary time series, ARIMA models use the integration (I) component to achieve stationarity. The order of differencing (\n",
    "�\n",
    "d) indicates the number of times differencing is required to make the series stationary.\n",
    "Seasonal Adjustments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-stationary time series with seasonality might require seasonal differencing or seasonal adjustments in addition to regular differencing."
