    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to the variations in a time series that occur periodically at specific intervals, such as days, weeks, months, or years. These variations are not fixed in amplitude or timing and can change over time, making them dependent on the point in time within the series. Time-dependent seasonality is common in many real-world time series data, where the strength and pattern of seasonal effects vary as the series progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike fixed seasonal patterns that remain consistent throughout the entire time series, time-dependent seasonal components adapt to changing conditions, trends, and external factors. They can capture variations that might not be adequately represented by fixed seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of time-dependent seasonal components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing Seasonality: Over time, the amplitude of the seasonal pattern increases. For instance, retail sales might exhibit higher seasonal spikes during the holiday season as years go by.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing Timing: The timing of seasonal peaks and troughs might shift over time. For instance, the timing of flu outbreaks might shift from year to year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amplitude Fluctuations: The strength of seasonal effects might fluctuate over time due to changing economic conditions, consumer preferences, or other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Cycles: Some time series might exhibit multiple seasonal cycles of different lengths, and the amplitude of these cycles can change over time."
