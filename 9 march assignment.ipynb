The thickness of the floor should be between 4 and 6 inches. However, it is possible that due to the nature of the construction process, the thickness of the concrete floor may vary slightly. We assume that the thickness of the floor is uniformly distributed between 4 and 6 inches. This means that any value of thickness between 4 and 6 inches has an equal chance of occurring.\n",
