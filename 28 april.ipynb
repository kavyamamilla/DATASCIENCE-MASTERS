        "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that aims to create a hierarchy of nested clusters within a dataset. Unlike other clustering techniques like K-means or DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand. Instead, it organizes data points into a tree-like structure, known as a dendrogram, where clusters can be formed at various levels of the hierarchy. Hierarchical clustering is well-suited for understanding the relationships between data points and identifying nested or hierarchical structures within the data.\n",

The root of the tree represents a single cluster containing all data points, and each leaf node represents an individual data point.
